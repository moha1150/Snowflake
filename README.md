# Snowflake
a simple webpage with a light blue background and animated snowflakes

When the webpage is loaded, it will display five snowflakes that fall down the page using a CSS animation.

The snowflakes are created using div elements with a snowflake class, and the animation is defined using a CSS @keyframes rule. The JavaScript code randomizes the starting position and falling duration of each snowflake to create a more realistic effect.

This website does not have any interactive features or functionality beyond displaying the animated snowflakes. It is intended to be a simple example of how you can use CSS and JavaScript to create a visually appealing webpage.
